	<h4>Technology</h4>
	
	<p>TweetStation is written in C# using <a href="http://monotouch.net">MonoTouch</a> 
	and most of the user interface elements were created with my <a href="http://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog">
	MonoTouch.Dialog</a> framework for rapidly creating table-based applications.
	
	<h4>Credits</h4>
	
	<p>The audio is from <a href="http://twitter.com/kmacleod">Kevin MacLeod</a> and the
	chicken noises were sampled at our Cambridge development office.
