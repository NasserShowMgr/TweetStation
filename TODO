*  Missing Stuff
	
	Progress widget to overlay for some tasks?

	Refresh user pictures when they change.  
		Currently, once we download a pic, we never update it

	Protocol:
		When posting a tweet, the POST data result should
		be added to the main view.

		When favoriting/unfavoriting, we need to add those
		tweets to Favorites tab, or recompute that tab
		on demand.

	TweetCell: Use only Draw calls?
		The tweetie blog suggested so

	On Load:
		Custom control to show "Load more" with some better artwork
		Support removal of the control on load, instead than on tap,
		to give a visual cue of what is happening.

	Nearby tweets
	composer:
		Uploading pictures
	TweetCell - Main Display
		Show star info, geo info, and pic info?

	Remove old tweets from the database, 2 week old tweets?
	Showing User Pictures
	Chicken noises for reload
	Music for composing
	Turning a search into a saved search
	Lists:
		Instead of managing lists, be able to "add user to list" in the UI in the profile view.
		Delete from list.
		Edit, Delete, Info
		Special List timeline controller that lets edit	
	User profile:	
		Red Color for Blocking users
		Showing first joined twitter
		Merge friends + followers in a single cell to save space?
		Showing a map for the user profile
		Show if the tweet is protected/user protected
		Show pictures if we recognize the url
	 Account editor
	New accont
	Hooking up OAuth
	Remember last tab

* Post 1.0:

	Direct Messages special view
		Grouped per user, blend conversation together

	Pagination support for StreamedUserViewController and StreamedTimelineViewController

* Wanted

	ActivityElement to support a message in addition to the activity

* Http Stack

	Since all calls to the twitter API are to the same server,
	we should have an API that serializes all calls, maybe even
	reuses the WebClient instance.

	WebClient does not use the ThreadPool, instead it uses a 
	new thread, perhaps move to HttpWebRequest?

	Need HttpWebRequest for POST anyways (needed for inserting
	the result of a post).

	Should support high-priority vs low-priority requests.  Some
	operations like trend fetching do not have to be a top 
	priority.

* Idea: Memory management

	Modify the TImelineController to reload data on demand, 
	since CocoaTouch does not really kill leaf instances
	of view controllers so we can end up carrying a lot of
	data around.

	Problem: we can only do this if a child is not currently
	visible.

* ImageStore:

	Support downloading different kinds of image sizes
	The 73x73 image for large views
	The full version for full display

* TweetDetail

	Put a border around the image loaded.
	Add support for loading twitpic images.


* Application

	Remember where we are (drilled down on a tweet? or search)

* Accounts

	Link to create account

	Support OAuth
