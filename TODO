* Usage Observations
	
	Swipe menu
		Retweet
		Reply
		Star
		Open (for links)
		Quote

	Only Load More tweets is shown

	TaskQueue should be bound to the accountid

	If the picture has been posted, do not bother trying to post it again

	Send needs to put some feedback about what is going on during the upload
	of a picture

	Sometimes when switch accounts the "Reloading" thing is still active

*  Missing Stuff

	Load 50 tweets, offer to load more DB storage
	
	Progress widget to overlay for some tasks?

	When I post, the icon should be on right?

	Include "themes" for rendering the bubbles?

	Refresh user pictures when they change.  
		Currently, once we download a pic, we never update it

	Protocol:
		When posting a tweet, the POST data result should
		be added to the main view.

	On Load:
		Custom control to show "Load more" with some better artwork
		Support removal of the control on load, instead than on tap,
		to give a visual cue of what is happening.

	Nearby tweets
	composer:
		Uploading pictures
	TweetCell - Main Display
		geo info, and pic info?

	Showing User Pictures
		Needs a custom image loader for user profiles and urls that we detect as pictures
	Chicken noises for reload
	Turning a search into a saved search

	Manual
	Advanced

* Post 1.0:


	When favoriting/unfavoriting, we need to add those
	tweets to Favorites tab, or recompute that tab
	on demand.

	Pondering feature:
		Replace "Reply, Direct, Quote, Retwweet"
		With something shroter

	Direct Messages special view
		Grouped per user, blend conversation together

	Pagination support for StreamedUserViewController and StreamedTimelineViewController

	Cell "themes"

	Group user names by letter, and show the letter selector on right

* Wanted

	ActivityElement to support a message in addition to the activity

* Http Stack

	Since all calls to the twitter API are to the same server,
	we should have an API that serializes all calls, maybe even
	reuses the WebClient instance.

	WebClient does not use the ThreadPool, instead it uses a 
	new thread, perhaps move to HttpWebRequest?

	Need HttpWebRequest for POST anyways (needed for inserting
	the result of a post).

	Should support high-priority vs low-priority requests.  Some
	operations like trend fetching do not have to be a top 
	priority.

* Idea: Memory management

	Modify the TImelineController to reload data on demand, 
	since CocoaTouch does not really kill leaf instances
	of view controllers so we can end up carrying a lot of
	data around.

	Problem: we can only do this if a child is not currently
	visible.

* ImageStore:

	Support downloading different kinds of image sizes
	The 73x73 image for large views
	The full version for full display

* TweetDetail

	Put a border around the image loaded.
	Add support for loading twitpic images.


* Application

	Remember where we are (drilled down on a tweet? or search)

* Accounts

	Link to create account

	Support OAuth
